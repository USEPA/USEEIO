# General Information
description: &desc >
    This USEEIO model, [model_name], was built useing useeior
    v[useeior_package_version] which can be found at
    https://github.com/USEPA/useeior. More information at USEEIO is available at
    https://www.epa.gov/land-research/us-environmentally-extended-input-output-useeio-models.

time_description: >
    [target_year] is the year in which this version of USEEIO was released and
    is the target date for the model. All dollar values reflect USD in 2012.

geographic_description: >
    Data represent the 50 US states.

technology_descripton: >
    The process describes the average US production of this good or service
    within this NAICS-based grouping defined in the BEA 2012 detailed input-output
    tables. Distribution, wholesale and retailing of this good or service, use,
    and final disposal are not included. Creation of a product system with this
    process will enable modeling of all upstream (supply-chain) activities.

# Administrative information
intended_application: >
    The primary application is for use in the US Environmentally-Extended Input-Ouput
    model, USEEIO, version [model_version]. This model is being used by the US EPA for
    supporting tools that prioritize goods and services based on potential environmental
    impacts, resource use or emissions for large regions, including the US and US
    states, and as a strealined tool for organizations as a starting point to
    consider sustainable materials management. Model results are designed to
    provide meso/macro-level decision support.

    The openLCA processes and flows for USEEIO were created from a complete model
    build in useeior using the script 'u2o.py' in the USEEIO respository at
    https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO/blob/master/olca/u2o.py. The JSON was imported into
    an empty database containing only the Federal LCA Commons Core Database.


access_restrictions: >
    This model should be appropriately cited (Ingwersen et al. 2022, see 'Publication' field
    above) when used. Any changes or derivations of this model by the user should be documented.
    The model itself and any results from use of this model shall not be construed
    to constitute US EPA opinion or policy.

project: >
    This research was funded by the USEPAs Sustainable and Healthy Communities
    Research Program. This research was supported through USEPA contract
    HHSN316201200013W, Task Order EP-G16H-01256 with General Dynamics IT (GDIT)
    and contract EP-C-16-015, Task Order 68HERC19F0292 with Eastern Research
    Group (ERG). Processing of Criteria and Hazardous Air Emissions was supported
    by the office of Fossil Energy (FE) for the United States Department of
    Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) under NETL
    Contract Number DE-FE0025912.


# Modeling and validation
lci_method: 'Input-output'

model_constants: >
    The reference unit of all processes is 1 USD2012 of the good or service.
    The technosphere inputs are based on the US BEA detailed input-output tables
    for 2012. The IO tables are combined to develop a commodity-by-commodity
    model based on the the industry-technology assumption, which assumes all
    commodities produced by a given industry have the same input structure, but
    that multiple industries can produce the same commodity. Thus, model
    technosphere flows represent commodity outputs (and not industry outputs)
    from other processes in the model. There are no by-products included in these
    processes. All commodity production is based on US-conditions, despite in
    reality that some goods and services are produced overseas, as USEEIO
    v[model_version] is a single-region IO model.

data_completeness: >
    The input-output approach assures that all purchased inputs associated with
    the sectors making these commodities as reported in the US census for 2012
    are included. The direct resources extracted including minerals, energy
    sources, water and land occupied are included. Emissions to air include all
    critieria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and hazardous and toxic air
    pollutants as defined by US EPA. Releases to water include toxics, total
    nitrogen and total phosphorus, and water discharges. Releases to soil or
    groundwater include toxics and agriculutural pesticides. Solid hazardous
    and non-hazardous wastes generated are included as waste flows.
